# CHESS tool extension with IoT design constructs FMEA, and Fault Tree Analysis.

   **---- FINISHED IMPLEMENTATION ----**
   
     - CHESSML lanaguage extended with IoT constructs
     - Perform safety analysis on designed system (cross -domain) 
     - Basic failure probaility assisgnment and generate probability file.
     - Fully generated FMEA table
     - Fully generate Fault tree
     - Analyse Fault tree (removing unnecessary propagations paths)
     - Conduct quantitative analysis (system's failure rates calculated)
     
   **--- FEATURES UNDER DEVELOPMENT (IoT domain) ----**
   
     - Functional level modeling of IoT systems
     - Platform code generation / emplyong ThingML
     - Design of deployment environment of IoT systems
     - Generate deployment artifact
     - Generated deployment autoamtion scripts
